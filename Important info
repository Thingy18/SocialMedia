You will have to create your own db 

Copy the sample.env file into a new .env file and modify the DATABASE_URL to connect to your own database

You will also need to run npm install

After creating database you will need to run 
npx prisma migrate dev 
The run
npx prisma db seed

Once that is done you will have a database set up with same sample info

I have also created a couple of functions for basic things to do 

You should create a separate branch for your algorithm I will create a separate branch for mine 

For the word cloud you will need to install python libraries
pip install wordcloud matplotlib pillow

word cloud is not yet complete I will finish the rest on friday
