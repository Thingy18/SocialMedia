Filters

The usage of filters for the posts was relatively straight forward. Everytime the code is run the algorithm pulls up the database through the route.ts file. Then the algorithm looks at the content of all the posts or their poster depending on which filter and checks if there is a match. The code then pulls whatever has passed the filter and proceeds as normal. In order to get the parameters for the filters the webpage has input boxes for a user. When the user has typed in their filters they simply have to press the generate word cloud button and a new filtered word cloud is created. The code is set up in a way that if a post has already been excluded it will not be rechecked with later parameters so while the worst case runtime of the filtering is O(f*p) where f is the number of filter parameters and p is the number of posts the runtime is likely to be shorter as each post that is filtered out improves the speed of going through the database.
